# TP Challenge

## Use case :

This data challenge involves classification task. The target variable is whether a customer will click 'Buy' on a website. Buy = 0 and Buy = 1 indicate 'no' and 'yes' respectively. Independent variables capture customer background and customer website navigation behavior information. First variable in the train.csv data file identifies each customer uniquely.

The challenge is to correctly predict if a customer will click 'buy' on a website.


## Dataset Description

There are three CSV files. In the train.csv file, 'Buy' is the target variable containing values 0 and 1. When Buy = 0, it means that the customer didn't click 'Buy'. When Buy = 1, it means that the customer did click 'Buy'. Each customer is uniquesly identified by 'Id' column in the train.csv and test.csv files.
